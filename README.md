# Movie-Recommendator
An octave powered application that recommends movies to users based on previous choices using collaborative filtering Machine Learning Algorithm.

Algorithm:
1.Initialize the movie ratings(xs) and the feature values(Thetas) to random small values.
2.Calculate the cost function and minimize it using Gradient Descent.
3.We then predict the movie ratings by 'Î¸Tx' and show the top 5-10 movies.


Instructions to use:
1.Have octave installed in the system.
2.Goto the directory where this project is saved and open "main.m".
3.Follow the instructions in the output window to run get the desired result.
